# Teensy4.1-ramps-shield

This is a RAMPS shield for teensy4.1.
The Marlin firmware now has support for teensy4.1.
There are no ready-to-use HW at this time.
So, I've designed one for myself.
It is work in progress and not really in my priority list.
The teensy4.1 work is still progressing, there may be pin changes and such.
So I may not move very fast on it.
Things to do:
1- Complete all the pin connections. 
2- Verify if all pins are properly mapped, using a RAMPS board and breadboard teensy4.1
2- Get it verified by the people in github teensy4.1 thread
3- Get it produced
4- Find and way for people to order them inexpensively. Osh park charges $42 for 3 of them.

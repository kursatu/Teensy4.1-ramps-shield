# Teensy4.1-ramps-shield

This is a RAMPS shield/adapter for teensy4.1.\
The Marlin firmware now has support for teensy4.1.\
But, I couldn't find a ready-to-use HW.\
So, I've designed one for myself.\
It only has female headers at this time and I'll try to keep it this way.\
It is work in progress and not really in my priority list. But it is something super easy to do. \
The teensy4.1 work is still progressing, there may be pin changes and such.\
So I may not move very fast on it.\
Here is the schema https://github.com/kursatu/Teensy4.1-ramps-shield/blob/main/schema.png \
Here is the board https://github.com/kursatu/Teensy4.1-ramps-shield/blob/main/board.png \

Here is the pin mapping

Teensy4.1 | Mega2560/RAMPS

TODO | TODO

To do:
- [ ] Verify if all pins are properly mapped, using a RAMPS board and breadboard teensy4.1
- [ ] Get it verified by the people in github teensy4.1 thread
- [ ] Get it produced
- [ ] Find and way for people to order them inexpensively. Osh park charges $42 for 3 of them.

Completed tasks:
- [X] Complete all the pin connections. Completed on Oct/13/2020
- [X] Order RAMPS board. Completed on Oct/14/2020
Ordered this RAMP 1.6 board.\
They are supposedly pin compatible with RAMP 1.4 of reprap.\
